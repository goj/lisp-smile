# lisp-smile

**Nothing to see here, move along**. This is an old project of mine (from the early university days).
This repo was created because I wanted to salvage it from the [Google Code shutdown](http://google-opensource.blogspot.ch/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html).
It was my attempt to write an identation-based syntax for lisp.
I had written all the code before I attended a class on compilers.
